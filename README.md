# iaminaki (Next.js)

Personal portfolio site rebuilt with Next.js and React while keeping the original SVG illustrations and messaging.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.

SVG illustrations live in `public/svg`. Pages are under `app/` using the Next.js App Router. The Vivus stroke animations are handled in `components/AnimatedIcon.js`.
